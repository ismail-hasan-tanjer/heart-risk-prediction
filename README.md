# Heart Disease Analysis & Prediction

## Abstract
This project aims to analyze heart disease data and predict the risk of heart disease using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify key factors related to heart disease and develop a model to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease. Leveraging **Databricks, Kafka, and Power BI**, we ensure scalable data processing, insightful visualization, and accurate predictions to support healthcare decision-making.

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Background
Heart disease remains a major global health challenge, affecting millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate prediction of heart disease can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. This project adopts a **data-driven approach** utilizing **machine learning and big data technologies** to predict heart disease risk, aiming to facilitate timely preventive measures.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Develop a **scalable data pipeline** for heart disease data processing.
- Implement **advanced data engineering techniques** to clean and preprocess heart disease data.
- Train and evaluate multiple **machine learning models** to predict heart disease risk.
- Visualize key health insights through **interactive Power BI dashboards**.
- Deploy **real-time predictive models** using **Apache Kafka** to enable continuous monitoring.

## 2. Literature Review
Extensive research has been conducted on heart disease prediction using machine learning. Studies highlight the importance of factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits. Models like **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** have shown promising results. This project builds on these studies to develop a more robust and scalable prediction pipeline.

## 4. Data Insights & Visualizations
I developed various visualizations using **Power BI** to identify trends and correlations related to heart disease:

- **Age-wise Risk Distribution:** Analyzing age as a key factor in heart disease.
- **Cholesterol vs. Disease Outcome:** Exploring cholesterol levels' impact.
- **Gender and Heart Risk:** Visual representation of gender-wise analysis.
- **Blood Pressure Analysis:** Correlation between hypertension and heart disease.
- **Smoking Status and Risk:** Investigating the link between smoking and heart conditions.
